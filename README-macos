Documenting steps to get it building on my Mac OS X Lion laptop.
These things were basically done as I came across errors during compilation.

Current status: Builds, runs, timers work, windows open, exercises, sounds all
present. Doesn't lock out other windows, and crashes on exit.

1. Created a virtualenv, installed Cheetah.
2. Using MacPorts, installed gtk2 +no_x11 +quartz (plus making sure all
   dependencies are +quartz too, e.g. cairo, pango, py27-pygtk, which was a bit
   of a faff when I got it wrong).
3. Installed glibmm, gtkmm, intltool.
4. Installed gtk-osx-application, but the bits of workrave using it are using
   the Carbon bits which aren't included in the compile. See e.g.
   https://github.com/GNOME/gtk-mac-integration/pull/1/files
   So built that separately including that pull request and put in the right
   place for MacPorts.
5. Made a couple of edits (in my fork here) to work around issues with
   undefined or too-defined symbols.

Steps to build:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --target i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 --prefix=...
    make
    make install
